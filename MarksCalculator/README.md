1. CIE Calculation: Calculate your CIE marks based on IA marks, quiz scores, and ABA marks.
2. Prediction: Estimate the combined IA marks needed to achieve a target CIE score.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The application offers a straightforward and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI).

### Usage
1. Run the Python script to launch the application.
2. In the main window, choose between "CIE Calculation" and "Prediction."
